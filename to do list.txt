To do list 08/08/23:

(1) Fix and sort modelling of electricity, gas and cost data
	- Cross-correlate electricity-gas, electricity-cost and gas-cost

(2) Process meteorological data - weather data
	- Read in data file correctly
(3) Analyse meteorological data - weather data
	- Initially assess each column of data
	- Time series analysis of each parameter
	- Pearson correlation of electricity -

(4) Analyse the energy consumption data alongside the meteorological data - weather data
	- Cross-correlate datasets?

(5) Develop the GUI app
	- Load in a dataset(s)
	- Visualise the dataset(s) - matplotlib
		-> Configure the type of plot to output
	- Visualise the dataset(s) - tabulated spreadsheet format
	- Output the summary data - text file 
	- Output the summary data - tabulated spreadsheet format

	- Add functionality to process pdf statement and read in datasets

Framework 1
(1) Load in raw dataset
(2) Process raw datasets - Gas, electricity & cost
(3) Reduce dimensionality - 1D data
(4) Model 1D data as function of time - regression
(5) Forecast/Predict 1D data - time instance
(6) Unpack and reverse dimensionality reduction
(7) Print forecasting - gas, electricity and cost

Framework 2:
(1) Load in raw dataset
(2) Process raw datasets - Gas, electricity & cost
(3) Model Gas as function of time
(4) Model electricity as function of time
(5) Model cost as a function of gas and electricity
(6) Forecast/Predict gas and electricity - time instance
(7) Estimate cost based on forecased gas and electricity usage
(8) Print forecasting - gas, electricity and cost
